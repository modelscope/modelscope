# Oh No! I'm Surrounded by LLMs! (LLMRiddles)

## Project Introduction
"Oh No! I'm Surrounded by LLMs!" is an intellectual challenge game. We use LLM to automatically generate corresponding game code based on existing Large Language Model (LLM) dialogue Gradio application codes within the ModelScope community, combined with preset questions from the Zhihu article ["How to Accomplish Tasks with 'Impossible'"](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/665393240), creating a unique gameplay experience. In this stream, players are required to cleverly construct questions that challenge the LLM to provide answers that meet specific conditions.

## News
November 9, 2023 - Added two new questions, and introduced the chatglm-turbo model ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
November 7, 2023 - Released the initial demo version ðŸ”¥
November 8, 2023 - Segregated level modules and LLM, enabling independent integration of levels and LLM. Pull Requests welcome ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥
