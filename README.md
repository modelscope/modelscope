# Introduction

[ModelScope]( https://www.modelscope.cn) is a “Model-as-a-Service” (MaaS) platform that seeks to bringing together most advanced machine learning models from the AI community, and to streamlining the process of leveraging and applying AI models . The core ModelScope library enables developers to perform model inference, training and evaluation, through rich layers of API designs that facilitate a unified experience across state-of-the-art models from different AI domains.

The Python library offers the layered-APIs necessary for model contributors to integrate models from CV, NLP, Speech, Multi-Modal, as well as Scientific-computation, into the ModelScope ecosystem. Implementations for all these different models are encapsulated within the library in a way that allows easy and unified access. With such integration, model inference, finetuning, and evaluations can be done within only a few lines of codes. In the meantime, flexibilities are provided so that different components in the model applications can be customized as well, where necessary.

Apart from harboring implementations of various models, ModelScope library also enables the necessary interactions with the backend services of ModelScope, particularly with the Model-Hub and Dataset-Hub. Such interactions facilitate various entity (models and datasets) management to be performed seamlessly under-the-hood, such as entity lookup, version control, and cache management.
