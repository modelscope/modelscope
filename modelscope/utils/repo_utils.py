        """Filter repo objects based on an allowlist and a denylist.

        Input must be a list of paths (`str` or `Path`) or a list of arbitrary objects.
        In the later case, `key` must be provided and specifies a function of one argument
        that is used to extract a path from each element in iterable.

        Patterns are Unix shell-style wildcards which are NOT regular expressions. See
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html for more details.

        Args:
            items (`Iterable`):
                List of items to filter.
            allow_patterns (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                Patterns constituting the allowlist. If provided, item paths must match at
                least one pattern from the allowlist.
            ignore_patterns (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*):
                Patterns constituting the denylist. If provided, item paths must not match
                any patterns from the denylist.
            key (`Callable[[T], str]`, *optional*):
                Single-argument function to extract a path from each item. If not provided,
                the `items` must already be `str` or `Path`.

        Returns:
            Filtered list of objects, as a generator.

        Raises:
            :class:`ValueError`:
                If `key` is not provided and items are not `str` or `Path`.

        Example usage with paths:
        ```python
        >>> # Filter only PDFs that are not hidden.
        >>> list(RepoUtils.filter_repo_objects(

    Returned by any method that creates a commit on the Hub: [`create_commit`], [`upload_file`], [`upload_folder`],
    [`delete_file`], [`delete_folder`]. It inherits from `str` for backward compatibility but using methods specific
    to `str` is deprecated.

    Attributes:
        commit_url (`str`):
            Url where to find the commit.

        commit_message (`str`):
            The summary (first line) of the commit that has been created.

        commit_description (`str`):
            Description of the commit that has been created. Can be empty.

        oid (`str`):
            Commit hash id. Example: `"91c54ad1727ee830252e457677f467be0bfd8a57"`.

        pr_url (`str`, *optional*):
            Url to the PR that has been created, if any. Populated when `create_pr=True`
            is passed.

        pr_revision (`str`, *optional*):
            Revision of the PR that has been created, if any. Populated when
            `create_pr=True` is passed. Example: `"refs/pr/1"`.

        pr_num (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of the PR discussion that has been created, if any. Populated when
            `create_pr=True` is passed. Can be passed as `discussion_num` in
            [`get_discussion_details`]. Example: `1`.

        _url (`str`, *optional*):
            Legacy url for `str` compatibility. Can be the url to the uploaded file on the Hub (if returned by
            [`upload_file`]), to the uploaded folder on the Hub (if returned by [`upload_folder`]) or to the commit on
            the Hub (if returned by [`create_commit`]). Defaults to `commit_url`. It is deprecated to use this
