"""Implements tracking of constraints for a beam item.

A list of constraints is given as a list of one or more token
sequences, each of length at least one token. For example, for an input sentence

> Die maschinelle Ãœbersetzung ist schwer zu kontrollieren.

We could have the constraints:
* to influence
* hard

There are two implementations:
* OrderedConstraintState: Tracks progress through an ordered list of multitoken constraints.
* UnorderedConstraintState: Tracks progress through an unordered list of multitoken constraints.

The difference is that in the first, the constraints are assumed to be
in order; the algorithm will permit zero or more tokens between them.
In the second, the constraints are not ordered, so many orderings will
be explored.

The same sequence can be present any number of times, and will appear
that many times in the output.
